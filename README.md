# Cargobikes study

We are given a historical set of delivery orders performed by a large logistics operator in the Central Business Districtic of Singapore.
Each order is described by destination latitute, destination longitude, shipment weight, service level, date. 

We use this data ias the base for a simulation analysis to assess the use of cargo bikes to satisfy such demand for urban goods deliveries.
